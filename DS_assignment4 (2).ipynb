    "Congratulations! You have successfully completed your assignment on creating machine learning models. In this part, we saw how implementations are already available in libraries such as Scikit Learn, which streamlines the entire process of machine learning. Various parameters can also be tuned in order to increase performances. <br> We hope that you enjoyed this assignment, and have gained some hands on experience of building machine learning models and classifiers. <br> \n",
